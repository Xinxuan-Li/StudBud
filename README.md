**Introduction To StudBud**

StudBud is a study web app that helps student to manage and plan out the operation of project assignments in school. It is equipped with functions: pomodoro timer, embeded lofi music player, and resource list to create an engaging and fun learning experience.

**Pomodoro Timer**

Pomodoro timer allows users to customise the number of rounds, break time and study time to adapt their personal learning habit. The timer is located in the nav bar to allow access anywhere on the web app.

**Music Player**

The music player contains 100 lofi songs retrieved from Spotify to create an relaxing and chill learning atmosphere. The web app only provides lofi because it is less disturbing and more comforting to listen to while studying.

**Project Management**

On this web app, users can create projects, assignment objectives and tasks to each project. The project page is templated to guide users to segment their big project into smaller chunks, which is cotegorised by stages. Within each stage of the project, users can create tasks with attributes: due date, estimate completion time, priority, tasks name, and keyword. Users can drag tasks to the corresponding completion status according to their own pace.

**Modifications from pitch**

1. Task content page is removed because it was unneccessary to have as almost all tasks attributes are already displayed on the task box. 

**Possible Futher Improvements**
