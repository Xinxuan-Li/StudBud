**Introduction To StudBud**

StudBud is a study web app that helps student to manage and plan out the operation of project assignments in school. It is equipped with functions: pomodoro timer, embeded lofi music player, and resource list to create an engaging and fun learning experience.

**Pomodoro Timer**

Pomodoro timer allows users to customise the number of rounds, break time and study time to adapt their personal learning habit. The timer is located in the nav bar to allow access anywhere on the web app.

**Music Player**

The music player contains 100 lofi songs retrieved from Spotify to create an relaxing and chill learning atmosphere. The web app only provides lofi because it is less disturbing and more comforting to listen to while studying.

**Resource List**
Resource list allows users to add valid links into the page, and tags can be created for each resource. Users can also write a summary, and save all contents by pressing the save button.

**Project Management**

On this web app, users can create projects, assignment objectives and tasks to each project. The project page is templated to guide users to segment their big project into smaller chunks, which is cotegorised by stages. Within each stage of the project, users can create tasks with attributes: due date, estimate completion time, priority, tasks name, and keyword. Users can drag tasks to the corresponding completion status according to their own pace.

**Comparison between proposed and final design**

1. Feedback in A3 suggested that the web app needs to guide people use the roadmap more carefully, so they they feel overwhelmed. An info button is added at the roadmap corner to introduce people how to use the roadmap adequately. 

2. To provide a clear roadmaping method, users can now mark stages as done according to their progression. Seeing which stages were completed can visualise the progression and know where they are at. Combining this function with expandable stages, users can just focus on one stage and feel less stressful as the other stages are not visible at that moment. 

2. Priority tags are colour coded to be better and more easily differentiated. People can spot the priority difference by the colour perception, without looking through a large task list to find the ones that are high priority. 

3. A motivational quote section is added in each project page so they feel more empowered. 

4. Only one tag can be added to resouce in the proposed design. Now multiple tags can be added to support note taking on the web.
